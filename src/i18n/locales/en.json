      "q2": "How long does the immigration process take on average?",
      "a2": "The duration of the immigration process varies considerably depending on the country, program, and individual circumstances. For Canada, the process can take between 6 and 24 months. Some express programs may be faster. Our consultants can give you a more accurate estimate based on your specific situation.",

      "a3": "Required documents vary according to the immigration program, but generally include: valid passport, diplomas and transcripts, proof of work experience, language proficiency certificates, birth certificate, marriage certificate if applicable, proof of sufficient funds, and sometimes a medical certificate and criminal record check.

    },
    "formation": {
      "q1": "How to create a CV that stands out from other applications?",
      "a1": "To create a standout CV, focus on customization for each position, highlight your achievements rather than just your responsibilities, use relevant keywords for your industry, adopt a clear and professional format, and include quantifiable data to demonstrate your impact. Our CV creation service can help you optimize your professional presentation.",
      "q2": "What mistakes should be avoided in a cover letter?",
      "a2": "Mistakes to avoid in a cover letter include: making a generic copy-paste, focusing only on your needs rather than on what you can bring to the company, using too casual language, making spelling or grammar mistakes, writing a letter that is too long, and simply repeating information from your CV without developing it."
    },
    "coaching": {
      "q1": "How to effectively prepare for a job interview?",
      "a1": "To prepare effectively for an interview, research the company and position in depth, prepare answers to common questions, practice with interview simulations, prepare relevant questions to ask, plan professional attire, and arrive early. Our interview coaching service can help you develop your confidence and interview skills.",
      "q2": "What are the benefits of professional coaching?",
      "a2": "Professional coaching offers many benefits, including: an objective outside perspective on your situation, personalized strategies to achieve your goals, support to overcome obstacles, improved self-confidence, development of new skills, and better stress management. Our certified coaches accompany you in your personal and professional development."
    },
    "orientation": {
      "q1": "How to identify the professional field that best suits me?",
      "a1": "To identify the professional field that suits you, analyze your interests, values and natural skills, explore different sectors of activity, talk with professionals, consider doing internships or volunteering to test different environments, and consider a skills assessment. Our career counselors will guide you in this reflection.",
      "q2": "What is a skills assessment and how does it work?",
      "a2": "A skills assessment is a process that allows you to analyze your professional and personal skills, aptitudes and motivations to define a professional project. It generally takes place in three phases: a preliminary phase to define your needs, an investigation phase to analyze your motivations and skills, and a conclusion phase that synthesizes the results and establishes an action plan."
    },
    "recruitment": {
      "q1": "How to find job offers that match my profile?",
      "a1": "To find job offers suited to your profile, use platforms specialized in your sector, activate your professional network, follow companies that interest you on social networks, register with recruitment agencies, participate in job fairs, and personalize your job alerts. Our recruitment service can help you target the most relevant opportunities.",
      "q2": "Which sectors are currently recruiting the most?",
      "a2": "Sectors that are currently recruiting the most include technology and IT, health and medical services, renewable energies, cybersecurity, e-commerce, and artificial intelligence. However, trends vary by region and are constantly evolving. Our consultants can provide you with up-to-date information on growing sectors in your target region."
